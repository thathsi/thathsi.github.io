About website sturcture I used html,css, javascript and php to create my website and connect it with the database over a server.

About database - I used wamp server to connect my database with my website. I created my database in wamp server in PhpMyAdmin.There is one table which is created for getting details. There are full name, email.When you fill the from, the database will collect those details to the table.
